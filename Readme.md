Mini-Prototype with SpringCloud


In this prototype we can access to an account of github which will have all configurations.

And our server will give credentials to the clients to access to the parts allowed by the user provided.

In the application.yml we have the configuration which our server can access to the github.

In URIConfigurations we will have the users with your permissions and the url's which they can access
